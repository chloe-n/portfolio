  <h2> The picture above shows a game I created/coded on Scratch with Bian. We made a paddleball game, using a dinosaur and dragon as the paddles and the earth as a ball. We made this in the Bank of America Girls Who Code location.

<h2> July 31, 2017: Today we programmed our robots to go through an obstacle course. We used whisker wires in order to make the robot sense when it hits an obstacle. Whenever an obstacle hits the whisker wires, the robot moves backwards and turns a certain amount of degress and then goes forward. The robot repeats this process until it passes through the obstacle course. Our obstacle course consisted of water bottles and soda cans that the robot had to go through.
